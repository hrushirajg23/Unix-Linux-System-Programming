     Advanced File I/O

     In this chapter we'll study:
     
     Scatter/gather I/O(vectored I/O):
          Allows a single call to read from or write data 
          to many buffers at once; useful for bunching together
          fields of different data structures to form once
          I/O transaction.
     
     Vectored I/O has many benefits over linear I/O in efficiency
     and performance

     writev() and readv() system calls are used 
     included in <sys/uio.h>
     where 

     1. ssize_t writev(int fd,const struct iovec *iov,int count);

     struct iovec{
          void *iov_base;    //pointer to buffers
          size_t iov_len;    //size of buffer in bytes 
     };
     This structure describes an independent disjoint buffer,
     which can be called as a SEGMENT;

     A set of segments is called a VECTOR.
     Each segment in the vector describes the address and length
     of a buffer in memory to or from which data should be written
     or read. 

     On success both system calls return number of bytes read or written.

     1. ssize_t readv(int fd,const struct iovec *iov,int count);

     count must be <=1024 i.e IOV_MAX
