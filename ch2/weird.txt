macOS is a sophisticated operating system developed by Apple Inc. for its line of Macintosh computers. Launched in 2001 as Mac OS X, it has undergone numerous updates and iterations, rebranding to OS X in 2012 and finally to macOS in 2016 to align with Apple's naming conventions for its other operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Built on a UNIX foundation, macOS offers a robust, stable, and secure environment with a user-friendly interface known as Aqua. Key features include the Spotlight search, the Siri virtual assistant, and seamless integration with other Apple devices through services like Handoff, Continuity, and iCloud. Renowned for its sleek design and powerful capabilities, macOS supports a wide range of professional applications, making it a popular choice among creatives, developers, and general users alike.
